# Audit Log

## Initial Entry

Date: 2026-05-05
Milestone: Milestone 0
Scope: Structural contracts, repo skeleton, backend/frontend stubs, Docker base, environment example, audit and smoke scripts.
Files created: Milestone 0 skeleton under `docs/`, `backend/`, `frontend/`, `templates/`, `db/`, `listmonk/`, `mailpit/`, `scripts/`, plus root config files.
Files modified: None; workspace was empty when skeleton was created.
Tests executed:
- `bash scripts/audit.sh`
- `docker compose config`
- `bash scripts/smoke_test.sh`
Tests not executed and reason:
- `PYTHONPATH=backend python3 -m pytest backend/tests` was attempted but local Python does not have `pytest` installed.
Risks remaining:
- Real auth is not implemented.
- Real sending is not implemented.
- listmonk runtime configuration is a skeleton and must be hardened before production.
- Database schema is intentionally minimal and not production-complete.
Confirmation:
  - no real sending implemented
  - no real AI implemented
  - no full dashboard implemented
  - no Keycloak implemented
  - no Celery implemented
  - no n8n workflows implemented
  - no Postal/Rspamd implemented

## Codex Skills Documentation

Date: 2026-05-05
Milestone: Codex Skills Documentation
Scope: docs-only operational skills
Files created/modified:
- Created `docs/codex_prompt_engine_v1.md`
- Created `docs/codex_skills/README.md`
- Created `docs/codex_skills/audit-runtime-flow.md`
- Created `docs/codex_skills/check-anti-monolith.md`
- Created `docs/codex_skills/extract-root-cause.md`
- Created `docs/codex_skills/generate-minimal-fix.md`
- Created `docs/codex_skills/run-regression-guard.md`
- Created `docs/codex_skills/update-docs-after-fix.md`
- Created `docs/codex_skills/audit-installer-vps.md`
- Created `docs/codex_skills/validate-state-and-persistence.md`
- Modified `scripts/audit.sh` to require the new Codex skill docs.
- Modified `docs/audit_log.md` with this entry.
Tests executed:
- `bash scripts/audit.sh`
- `bash scripts/smoke_test.sh`
- `docker compose config`
Tests not executed and reason:
- Backend pytest and frontend lint/build were not run because this was a docs-only change with no backend or frontend behavior touched.
Risks remaining:
- These skills are operational guidance only; future prompts must explicitly apply the relevant skill.
Confirmation: no application code changed
